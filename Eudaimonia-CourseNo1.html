<p class="p1"><strong>1. Mindfulness</strong></p>

     <p style="font-size: 25px;text-align: center;"><strong>•	What's mindfulness?</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">There are two meanings to the phrase mindfully.
One, meaning it is a state of full focus, where instead of over-evaluating the distracting thoughts in your mind you simply let them go. You write this word with a single ‘’L’’
And the other meaning a state where you are invested in thoughts, and overthinking. You write this phrase with a double ‘’L’’
The state that we want to get more into is the mindful state written with a single L. You want to be able to acknowledge your distractions without excessively evaluating them. ‘’The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence’’
Also, beware that mindfulness is something different from meditation but still associated with it. Meditation is a practice and being mindful is a state. Other than that there’s really not much difference between them.</p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"><strong>•	How to train your mindfulness</strong>
One way to train your mindfulness is to observe your thoughts without evaluating them. Simply being aware of your thoughts but not acting upon them is a very precious skill to have. You probably heard about femininity and masculinity. These two form a good example. Let’s say that acting on your emotions on the go is femininity (because that’s what femininity means, using your emotions to make most if not all of the decisions. It doesn’t necessarily mean that being feminine is bad, feminine women are probably the best that you can find if you have a strong masculine core)
 and thinking through your decisions (being rational) is masculinity.  If you tend to be or want to be a more masculine man you should be able to differentiate between your emotions and rational decisions. 
One of the best ways to train your mindfulness is to simply meditate. Meditation is a great practice that has many benefits including the formation of and training the ability to be mindfull. The rest of this course is entirely given to the art of meditation where you will learn:</p>

<p class="p2"><strong>2. Mindfulness- My story about how I got into meditating</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>•	My story</strong></p>
       <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">Throughout my journey I had many ups and downs, I didn’t feel like meditating at first, even though I was excited about the journey it never really kept me consistent. Procrastination and constant excuses slowed me down. But then I remembered that this is why I started this journey, to not let my mind take me over, to be and audience watching a constant dance called life. You probably experienced at least one of these problems, lack of concentration, mind wandering, addiction, all of these are the symptom of you not being able to focus on the task at hand. I had the same problem, but don’t worry, meditation is here for the rescue. If you learn how to meditate and how to keep your focus for longer periods of time, life will be open to you,  as you will be able to enjoy every moment and make the best out of it. Life is full of boring moments, everyday you experience at least a slight feeling of boredom, the key to life is to learn how to enjoy that moment, no matter how boring it is.</p>
</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>3. Mindfulness- What is Mindfulness?</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>•	What's meditation</strong></p>
       <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">Now we come to age ancient old question: ‘’What is meditation?’’. Meditation can be defined in a variety of ways, some say that meditation is a practice that increases your levels of concentration, and some may say that it conects you with nature and helps you understand your true self. Both of these statements are true, there’s nothing wrong with any of these, but how you interpret meditation is up to you. Throughout the duration of this course Im going to switch between the two of these definitions independently to help you understand meditation more clearly and concisly.
Other than what I just mentioned, meditation is pretty straight forward. Set a timer anywhere from a minute up to an X amount of time, sit down, close your eyes and notice how your thoughts go one by another in the endless passage of time. Try to keep your focus on the breath, if you notice your focus is shifting, slowly, but surely try to bring it back to your breath. Do you see how simple it is? Now you may be asking yourself questions like ‘’How does such a simple practice make such a huge benefit?’’, you probably won’t believe it, but it’s true, and that’s why meditation is so unique. There’s many practices as meditation, but none of them are as simple and as effective as meditation itself. You can start meditating right now just folow the steps above and you’re all set.</p>
     <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">As you can see meditation is a simple practice that anyone can do at any time, all you have to do I focus on your breath, feel your chest expanding, and if you can, close your eyes, sit in a criss-cross position and rest your hands on your lap. Now another thing that comes to mind is for how long you should meditate.</p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>	Duration</strong></p>

       <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">I recommend starting short and adding a few more minutes every few weeks. That way you’re less prone to failure. Getting too excited and jumping to a longer duration than you’re able to go through is a bad idea. Do it like I said, increase it every few weeks by a minute or two and you’re all set.
A very important thing to acknowledge is that it isn’t really necessary to increase your sessions' duration too much. The more you can notice and let your thoughts go the Less you have to meditate. If you can stay fully focused on the intention of your meditation session for let's say full 3 minutes then all you need is a three-minute meditation session. If you were to increase the duration to 10 minutes but lost focus for the rest of the session in the first few minutes then what is the point of even doing it? Start with smaller sessions and try to master those first and then go on to longer durations.
Start with a 3-minute session and consecutively increase the duration by a few minutes each week.</p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>	Mindset</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">One of the most important things that you should never forget about is mindset change. If you don’t adopt the right mindset you will never succeed at meditating, you will never succeed at anything if you don’t change your way of thinking. Adapting the right mindset is the key to success in any part of life. What is that mindset? That is the growth mindset. The growth mindset can be easily explained. The growth mindset is when you acknowledge that you can’t do a certain thing yet but through practice, failure, persistence and sheer fucking will you will be able to master it. As they say ‘’practice makes the master’’</p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>	Process</strong></p>
                                          <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;">Four-step meditation process</p>                                              .
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center; color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;">Full focus--> Lost of focus --> Noticing that you lost focus --> Regaining that focus back--> Repeat
Meditation is a pretty straightforward practice. As soon as you notice you lose focus just regain it. It's that simple.
Don't worry whenever you lose focus. Losing your focus is a part of meditation, the key is to notice and regain that focus back. If a thought starts distracting you, briefly notice it and go back to your breath.
Meditation is a refocusing practice. Many people think that in order to be a successful meditator then you have to keep your focus for the entire session which just isn’t true. Be more focused on re-focusing than on focusing the entire time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><strong>•	When should you meditate?</strong></p>
         <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">Choose the time that works for you the best, if you know that meditating in the morning is the best option then do it. As soon as you wake up and make your bed meditate for at least three minutes, it will help you with your concentratio throughout the rest of the day. If you’re better off meditating in the evening or in the night hours then go for it, the key is consitence, no matter how long, when and where, what matters is that you did it.
Idealy you should meditate in a calm and quiet place to help your mind in focusing.</p>

<p class="p4"><strong>4. Mindfulness- How to make meditation a habit</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong>I'll guide you through the four practical steps that will help you form the habit of meditation and increase the chances of you not breaking that habit once it's settled.  </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong>	Step 1-Make it obvious  </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"> Make it obvious, choose a specific time or place that will help you in settling the habit. 
The more obvious it is that this time and place are assigned to your daily meditation session the more likely you are to complete it. Set aside a bit of time in your schedule for that session, it would be great if you did that.  </p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong> 	Step 2-Make it attractive </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"> Make it pleasant, build up your anticipation throughout the day, but be careful, the joy of thinking about that meditation session can sometimes be more satisfying than actually doing the thing.   </p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong> 	Step 3-Make it easy </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">  I already discussed how you can use the duration of your sessions to your advantage. Instead of meditating for 10 minutes straight away, you should gradually increase the duration of your sessions little by little until you get to your desired duration. That way you make meditation easier, and more fun as you reach greater heights each and every day. </p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong> 	Step 4 Make it satisfying </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"> Usually, you will not see the benefits of meditation until you do a couple of these sessions consistently. That can make meditation a bit unsatisfying. Waiting for the result may take too long and your will to continue may go away. You need to make it instantly satisfying. Track it. The single best way to make your daily meditation session satisfying is to track it. Use your journal or maybe stick a piece of paper on your wall and after each succesfull session mark it down. Maybe make a goal of how many sessions you wanna reach this month, it'll help you to stay more consistent. Tracking your meditation sessions is obvious, attractive, and satisfying. So maybe consider making a plan and tracking your sessions, It'll help you a lot.  </p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><strong> •	Have an accountability partner </strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"> An accountability partner is someone, who keeps you on track with your habit, he keeps you accountable that you do the habit.  An accountability partner can be anybody as long as you trust him and know that he will keep you accountable. So if you can't get into meditating and you miss more than half of your planned session. Get a friend and tell him that each time you won't do a session you will pay him 10$, and to make it harder, tell him that you will record each session and send it to him right after completing it so that he is sure you did it.  </p>

<p class="p5"><strong>5. Midnfulness-Different Types of Perception</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;">	Are there different types of perception?</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"> First of all, what’s perception? Simply put, perception is the way you see the world or, the thing that you are focused on in the moment. You can either be focused on what’s going on inside you like your breath or heartbeat (interoception), or something that's outside of you like a point or an object (exteroception). Perception can be manipulated in a variety of ways, but mainly these two. interoception and exteroception are vast topics that would require a lot more than just a page of content, yet, this is a simplified version containing only the most relevant subjects, if you want to know more you can head to Andrew Huberman’s video on this subject https://youtu.be/wTBSGgbIvsY?si=olfV35LGpmLPOQkSy. Anyways, interoception and exteroception are contrary, one focuses more on our bodily sensation while the other has a wider focus on the things outside of us. While none of these are good or bad in moderation, if you take your focus too far on one side of the perception spectrum then you can experience some problems, mainly associated with lack of concetration. And yes, there is a thing like overdosing on perception, although metaphorically speaking, it’s still an overdose. That overdose can happen when for example, you spend too much time doing an interoceptive or an exteroceptive meditation practice, or when you don’t get enough sleep. The way to apply these types of perception into a meditation practice is very simple.</p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;">	Interoceptive and exteroceptive types of meditation practices</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;">Your breath plays a big part in your ability to choose between interoceptive and exteroceptive practices. If you are more focused on the flow of the breath you are practicing an interoceptive session. If your primary focus is a point on the wall or in the distance rather than your breath or a sensation inside your body, then you are doing an exteroceptive practice.
The way to choose which type of meditation you should do is to analyze whether you are more interoceptively or exteroceptively aware in the moment and based on that do a practice opposite to that state.
And that’s about all that you have to know about the interoceptive and exteroceptive spectrum/perception. Simply put, interoceptive meditation is a breathing-based practice and exteroceptive meditation is a point/object-focused practice.
This is all I had, thanks and see you later!
